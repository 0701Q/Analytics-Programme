###Question 1 
##Task explanation


This question aims to analyse how COVID-19 patients are distributed geographically (by county) and demographically (by age group).
The analysis involves identifying patients diagnosed or suspected with COVID-19, then visualising their distribution using histograms (bar charts).

##Analysis 1: The distribution of COVID patients across counties
```{r}
#1. Filter conditions to find COVID patients (confirmed or suspected)
covid_patients_id <- conditions %>%
  filter(str_detect(DESCRIPTION, regex("COVID", ignore_case = TRUE))) %>%
  distinct(PATIENT) %>%
  rename(Id = PATIENT)
#I extract a unique list of patient IDs whose condition description contains the word “COVID”. This step isolates the relevant subset of patients for further analysis.
# 2. Merge the list of COVID patients with the demographic dataset
covid_patients_with_county <- patients %>%
  inner_join(covid_patients_id, by = "Id") %>%
  select(Id, COUNTY)
#I join the filtered COVID patient IDs with the patients dataset to include county information.This helps analyse how many COVID patients are recorded per county.
# 3. Calculate patient distribution by county
county_distribution <- covid_patients_with_county %>%
  count(COUNTY, name = "Patient_Count", sort = TRUE)
#I use count() to summarise the total number of patients per county. The result is sorted in descending order to identify the most affected areas.

# 4. Display county summary table
kable(county_distribution, caption = "Distribution of COVID patients across counties") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
#The table clearly shows how COVID-19 cases vary by county. I use kable() for neat and professional formatting suitable for reports.
# 5. Create the histogram (bar chart) visualization for County distribution
county_plot <- county_distribution %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(COUNTY, -Patient_Count), y = Patient_Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#3399FF") + 
  labs(title = "COVID-19 Patient Distribution Across Counties",
       x = "County",
       y = "Number of COVID Patients") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8)) 

#A bar chart (histogram-style) visualises the concentration of COVID-19 patients by county. It highlights which geographic areas have the highest case volumes.
```
##Interpretation 
The histogram clearly illustrates that the distribution of COVID-19 patients is highly uneven (skewed) across the counties. There is a significant disparity in patient counts, with Middlesex County reporting over 1,500 cases, which is substantially higher than other large counties like Worcester and over a hundred times greater than the sparsely populated counties of Dukes and Nantucket. This stark difference is primarily attributable to variations in population size and density, as major metropolitan areas typically serve as hubs for both residence and service use, leading to higher population totals and consequently, higher absolute case counts.
##Analysis 2: the distribution of patients across age groups (e.g., 0-18,19-35, 36-50, 51+)
```{r}
#1. Merge patient demographics and calculate age
reference_date <- as_date("2025-10-17")

covid_master_data <- patients %>%
  inner_join(covid_patients_id, by = "Id") %>%
  mutate(
    BirthDate = as_date(BIRTHDATE),
    Age = floor(time_length(interval(BirthDate, reference_date), unit = "year"))
  ) 
#I merge the COVID patient list with demographics and compute each patient’s age in years.
#2. Assign each patient into defined age groups
covid_master_data <- covid_master_data %>%
  mutate(
    Age_Group = case_when(
      Age <= 18                   ~ "0-18",
      Age >= 19 & Age <= 35       ~ "19-35",
      Age >= 36 & Age <= 50       ~ "36-50",
      Age >= 51                   ~ "51+",
      TRUE                        ~ "NA/Unknown"
    ),
    Age_Group = factor(Age_Group, levels = c("0-18","19-35","36-50","51+","NA/Unknown"))
  )
#Patients are grouped into four meaningful age categories to facilitate comparison. I convert the variable to a factor to maintain order in visualisation.

#3. Count the number of COVID-19 patients in each age group
age_distribution <- covid_master_data %>%
  distinct(Id, Age_Group) %>%
  count(Age_Group, name = "Patient_Count", sort = FALSE)
#I ensure each patient is counted once per age group, avoiding duplicate rows. This provides a clear demographic breakdown of the infected population.
#4. Display the summary table
kable(age_distribution, caption = "Distribution of COVID patients across Age Group") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
#The table summarises how many COVID-19 cases fall into each age bracket. It supports visual interpretation and descriptive commentary.
#5.Create the histogram (bar chart) visualization for Age distribution
age_plot <- age_distribution %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = Age_Group, y = Patient_Count)) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#FF6666") +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "COVID-19 Patient Distribution Across Age Groups",
                x = "Age Group",
                y = "Number of COVID Patients") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
# This bar chart provides an intuitive visual comparison across age categories.It helps highlight which demographic groups are most affected by COVID-19.
```
##Interpretation
From the plot, we see that The Age Group distribution reveals a bimodal pattern. The highest number of COVID-19 patients falls within the 51+ Age Group (approximately 3,000 cases). This is likely due to the compromised immune systems and higher prevalence of comorbidities typical in older populations, making them more susceptible to infection and severe illness.

Following closely is the 19-35 Age Group (approximately 1,700 cases). This can be attributed to their high mobility and occupational exposure, as they constitute the primary workforce, increasing their likelihood of coming into contact with high-risk environments.

Conversely, the 0-18 Age Group shows the lowest number of cases, potentially reflecting lower social contact rates or lower observed symptoms in children.

###Question 2 
##Task explanation
This question investigates the common non-COVID conditions, primarily the symptoms and comorbidities, that experienced by patients who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The task involves two main parts:

Identifying and ranking the Top 5 most common non-COVID conditions (i.e., symptoms) among COVID-affected patients.

Comparing the Top 10 conditions by gender to explore whether symptom prevalence and comorbidity patterns differ between male and female patients.

Through data filtering, grouping, and visualisation, this analysis aims to highlight the most frequent co-occurring health issues among COVID patients and reveal any gender-based variations in health outcomes.

##Analysis 1: Top 5 most common non-COVID conditions among COVID patients
```{r}
#1. Precheck 
stopifnot("Id" %in% names(covid_patients_id))
covid_patients_id <- covid_patients_id %>% distinct(Id)
#I do this to ensure covid_patients_id exists and is unique per patient

#2.Keep ONLY conditions belonging to patients who ever had COVID, but EXCLUDE the COVID rows themselves
covid_comorbidities <- conditions %>%
  semi_join(covid_patients_id, by = c("PATIENT" = "Id")) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(DESCRIPTION, regex("COVID", ignore_case = TRUE)))
#I use semi_join expresses the intent clearly: filter conditions to those patients; then remove COVID strings.
#3. Clean DESCRIPTION to avoid duplicate labels due to casing/spacing
covid_comorbidities <- covid_comorbidities %>%
  mutate(DESCRIPTION = DESCRIPTION %>% stringr::str_squish() %>% stringr::str_to_title()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(DESCRIPTION) & DESCRIPTION != "")
#I standardise text and drop missing values to make frequency counts reliable
#4. Top 5 most common conditions
top_conditions_global_occ <- covid_comorbidities %>%
  count(DESCRIPTION, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)
#This answers “most common conditions” in terms of how often they appear in the records.
#5. Display the summary table of top 5 most common conditions other than COVID-19
kable(top_conditions_global, caption = " Top 5 most common non-COVID conditions among COVID patients") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
#I use kable() to present the results in a professional, report-ready format. The table clearly present the top 5 most common conditions other than COVID-19 among COVID patients
```
##Interpretation
From the table, we see that top 5 most common non-COVID conditions among COVID patients are "Fever", "Cough", "Loss of taste", "Fatigue", and "Body mass index 30+ - obesity"
##Analysis 2: Top 10 Non-COVID Conditions by Gender
```{r}
#1. Join the COVID comorbidities dataset with patient demographics to access gender.
comorb_with_gender <- covid_comorbidities %>%
  left_join(patients %>% select(Id, GENDER), by = c("PATIENT" = "Id"))
#I enrich the comorbidity dataset with gender from the patients table. This enables gender-based comparison of condition frequencies among COVID-affected patients.
#2. Count unique patients per condition per gender and select top 10
top10_by_gender <- comorb_with_gender %>%
  distinct(GENDER, PATIENT, DESCRIPTION) %>%   
  count(GENDER, DESCRIPTION, sort = TRUE) %>%  
  group_by(GENDER) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%                       
  ungroup()
#I count how many unique patients of each gender have each non-COVID condition. The distinct() step ensures no duplicate patient-condition pairs are counted twice.
#3. Display a summary table showing the top 10 non-COVID conditions by gender
kable(
  top10_by_gender %>% arrange(GENDER, desc(n)),
  caption = "Top 10 Non-COVID Conditions by Gender (Unique Patients)",
  col.names = c("Gender", "Condition", "Unique Patients")
) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
#I use kable() to present the results in a professional, report-ready format. The table clearly compares the top 10 conditions between male and female COVID patients.
#4. Create a bar chart comparing condition counts by gender
ggplot(top10_by_gender, aes(x = reorder(DESCRIPTION, n), y = n, fill = GENDER)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Non-COVID Conditions by Gender",
       x = "Condition",
       y = "Number of Unique Patients",
       fill = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 10))
#A horizontal bar chart provides an intuitive visual comparison of the top 10 non-COVID symptoms for each gender. This helps highlight any gender-based differences in condition frequency.
```

##Interpretation
The analysis of non-COVID conditions among COVID-affected patients reveals several key patterns.
Across the overall cohort, the most frequent conditions—fever, cough, loss of taste, and fatigue—represent the classic symptomatic profile of COVID-19 infection. These findings confirm that the dataset accurately captures realistic symptom and comorbidity patterns.
When comparing results by gender, both male and female patients exhibit similar top-ranked symptoms, but notable differences emerge in specific conditions.
Female patients report slightly higher frequencies of fatigue, loss of taste, and reproductive-related conditions such as miscarriage in the first trimester, whereas male patients show greater prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and dyspnea.
These variations may reflect biological and hormonal differences as well as behavioural and lifestyle factors influencing health outcomes.
